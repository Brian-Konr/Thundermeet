## Getting Started

1. clone this repository
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Brian-Konr/Thundermeet.git
  ```
2. `cd` to this repository
3. In the root of this repository, add the env file named `.env.development`. Within the file, you should put in the following environment variables:
  ```
  VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
  VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_API_KEY
  VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://thundermeet-backend.herokuapp.com
  VITE_FRONTEND_URL=localhost:3000
  ```
  > Reminder: If you don't have your own Google Client ID and API key, you can still execute this app without using any of the Google OAuth features the app provides.
4. Open your terminal and run `yarn` to install the [dependencies](package.json)
5. In the same terminal, run `yarn dev` to run the app in the development mode
6. voilà! you should see a brand new Thundermeet running in your localhost

  > Notice: If the terminal reports error about the dependency problem after you execute `yarn dev`, you may fix it by commenting the 3rd line on `node modules/react-schedule-selector/dist/ScheduleSelector.js`
